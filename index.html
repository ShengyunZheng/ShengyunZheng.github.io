       <p> My name is Shengyun(Mike) Zheng. Currently I am a student at Thomas A. Edison High school. <br>
            I am really interested in computers in general and wanted to get into computer programming and <br>
            I decided to take Web design shop class and learn about coding and web development, using python, <br>
            javascript and photoshop. This is my portfolio of my projects that I am pround of that I did in class. <br>
            The projects I did in class that I am showing heeon my page are Unit 6 Project, Final Project and Project(character quiz). <br>
            I will also maybe be updating once in a while with my personal hobbies in the future.
