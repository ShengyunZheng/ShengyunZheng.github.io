      <h1> Shengyun's Portolio </h1>
        <p> My name is Shengyun(Mike) Zheng. Currently I am a student at Thomas A. Edison High school. I am really interested in computers in general and wanted to get into
            computer programming and I decided to take Web design shop class and learn about coding and web development, using python, javascript and photoshop. This is my portfolio of my 
            projects that I am pround of that I did in class.
