      <h1> Shengyun's Portfolio </h1
       <p> My name is Shengyun(Mike) Zheng. Currently I am a student at Thomas A. Edison High School. 
            I am really interested in computers in general and wanted to get into computer programming and 
            I decided to take Web design shop class and learn about coding and web development, using python, 
            javascript and photoshop. This is my portfolio of my projects that I am proud of that I did in class. 
            The projects I did in class that I am showing here on my page are Unit 6 Project, Final Project and Character Quiz Project.
            I will also be updating once in a while with my personal hobbies in the future.
