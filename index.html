      <h1> Shengyun's Portfolio </h1>
        <p> My name is Shengyun(Mike) Zheng. Currently I am a student at Thomas A. Edison High school. 
            I am really interested in computers in general and wanted to get into computer programming and <br>
            I decided to take Web design shop class and learn about coding and web development, using python, 
            javascript and photoshop. This is my portfolio of my projects that I am pround of that I did in class.
